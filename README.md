# Employee_Tracker

### <ins>Description<ins>
Welcome to my SQL employee database tracker where users can easily view and interact with information through the command-line of the application that is stored in an SQL Employee Tracker database.

## Overview
### <ins>The Challenge:<ins>
    Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). Your assignment this week is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

### <ins>User Story:<ins>
    AS A business owner
    I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
    SO THAT I can organize and plan my business

### <ins>Acceptance Criteria:<ins>
    GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
    WHEN I start the application
    THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role
    WHEN I choose to view all departments
    THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids
    WHEN I choose to view all roles
    THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
    WHEN I choose to view all employees
    THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to
    WHEN I choose to add a department
    THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database
    WHEN I choose to add a role
    THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database
    WHEN I choose to add an employee
    THEN I am prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database
    WHEN I choose to update an employee role
    THEN I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database
